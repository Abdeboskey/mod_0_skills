This is my submission to the Mod_0 technical assesment in Turing's Mod_0

* I made some small edits to some of my attribute names in class_1.txt and class_1_example_objects.txt upon reviewing them _after_ I submitted the assessment. I noted that those changes were made after submission in the commits I made to save said changes, just to be clear about what was done during the official assessment time limit, and to show that I understand what I could have done better when naming those attributes.
